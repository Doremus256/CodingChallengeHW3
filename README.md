The purpose of this project is to become more comfortable with JavaScript functionality. Our goal is to create a quiz application which will automatically move to each question and save the user's initials and score. 

The functions are still very complex for me - I am always looking for better ways to arrange everything, which is why I had to blow this up and start from scratch not once but twice. 


Thank You!
